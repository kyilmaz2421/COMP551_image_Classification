# COMP551_image_Classification
In, this project we compared the performance of a multilayer perceptron and a convolutional
neural network on an image classification problem with
the CIFAR-10 dataset. As requested we create a multilayer perceptron from scratch and use a tutorial to build
the convolutional neural network. Lastly, we compare
the train and test performance of the two models as a
function of epochs. To further improve our multilayer
perceptron we implemented a grid search for hyper
parameter tuning as well as momentum and velocity. In
the end the convolutional neural network out performs
the multilayer perceptron by getting an 88.72% accuracy
whereas the multilayer perceptron only gets a 39.4%
accuracy
